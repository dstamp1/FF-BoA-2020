######## Why do we even need a database #######

# Let's say we wanted to build a site where we could post community events and important dates. I want to site to be able to show events + add events.
# I coded together this app last night: https://community-board-dstamp.herokuapp.com/

## Take 2 minutes to explore my site (it only has two pages) and add an event


### At this point, you probabl noticed that the events we added individually aren't showing up on everyone elses page even though we all visited the same website.

## If we look at the code, we see that the original evennts list is hard coded.

### To have a site where multiple users can access and add data for other users to interact with, we need a centralized way to store data. Databases give us the way to do that. We will learn how to user MongoDB.

## This app is just an example of what's possible by incorporating MongoDB. Before we explore how to do that, first let's learn how to interact with an existing MongoDB database.
